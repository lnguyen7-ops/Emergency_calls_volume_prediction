Not done: 	-
Done: 		x-
Maybe: 		*-


x- Map: add back 
	- 'city block'
	- 'neighborhood' choropleth.

- Call category plot: map the call category to more understandable words. Do this after category aggregation for better speed.
	- Bar plot axis still use abbreviation on y-axis to save space but hover should shows details.
	- Category selection dropdown should show descriptive version.

x- Time plot: Add day of week name to hoover data.

- Data filtering: Add categorical options for
	- Hour of day
	- Day of week
	- Month of year

*- UI: Change 'start date' and 'end date' to allow for invidual entry ot year, month, date for quicker selection

x- UI: add filled bar to indicate how much data were selected.

x- UI: End date in title line update with last date in dataset.

- Hist plot: Add seperate line for each call priority. Or maybe just the top 3 priorities.

- Hist plot: Add MEDIAN markders

x- Functions: fix functions for properuse of 'selection' in vaex, instead of always set 'selection'=True

x- Choropleth: only switch to block-level vieew after certain zoom.
	This is because rendering all 19K geojson blocks is too laggy. Therefore, only render a few blocks.

- Comment on the fact that when trying to specify selection name (e.g. name='some_name') in .select() and pass on to other sub-sequence filter, the filter process got messed up. Incorrect data were returned. Lots of data were missing as well.

- Choropleth: See a way to improve performance when panning the map in City-Block view.

- Graphs: switch to specifing RELATIVE size instead of absolute pix so account for different device screens.

- Data filtering: RETHINK about throwing data with negative time.

- Data filtering: Dynamic update of sub-sequence dropdowns.

- Data filtering: Call-made-by-officer dropdown change to check box: Call made by: Resident, Officer

- Category dropdown: Show the most common categories first.

- Interactivity between graphs: clicking on graph elements actually trigger filter.

- Filter: Perhaps all the continuous features (i.e. times) should be changed to small distribution graph where user can actually select the range on there.
